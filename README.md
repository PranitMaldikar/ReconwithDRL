## Overview
This project introduces a new algorithm named Poly-Phasic Gradient-3D (PPG-3D) designed for navigating drones in obstacle-rich environments using reinforcement learning.

## Features
- **Algorithm Development**: Created, designed, and implemented a novel navigation algorithm, PPG-3D, based on the existing PPG algorithm.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Leveraged reinforcement learning to optimize the action-taking policy for drone navigation. Trained and generalized the model using virtual sensory data from LiDAR and image data processed with OpenCV.
- **Multiagent Reinforcement Learning**: Implemented multiagent reinforcement learning to enhance navigation efficiency in complex environments.
- **Realistic Simulations**: Utilized the Unity engine to import and interact with realistic obstacle-rich environments, providing robust training scenarios for the algorithm.
- **Research Publication**: Authored a research paper detailing the PPG-3D algorithm and its applications, currently up for publishing.
